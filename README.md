# AggriAssist
AgriAssist is a data-driven, command-line application (CLI) built in Python. Its goal is to provide actionable insights for farmers and transparent pricing information for customers. The project leverages a machine learning model for predictive analysis and a rule-based system for generating specific, real-time advice on crop management.
